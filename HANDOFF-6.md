## How To Use This Document

Single source of truth for any new session, contributor, or Claude instance.
Read this before touching any code. Every decision traces to one of the 16 source
documents listed at the bottom.

## The Founding Principle

> Users become believers the first time the plan adapts around something that went
> wrong in their life. Everything traces back to that moment.

The adaptation feature is both the product's greatest moment and its primary revenue
mechanic. It sits behind the paywall deliberately.
