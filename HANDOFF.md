## Product Position

**NextSplit** is a running training app built around social accountability. The core thesis: the number one predictor of long-term running consistency is having people who notice when you don't show up.

**Go-to-market strategy:** Athlete-first → athlete invites friends via squad → squad introduces coach → coach brings their full roster.

**Pricing:** Free tier (plans + basic logging) + Elite £7.99/mo founding price (AI coaching, ACWR, adaptive plans, squad leadership, coach marketplace). 500 founding member spots.

**Three pillars:**
1. **Bespoke digital coaching** — predetermined plans (17 templates), AI-generated plans, coach-authored plans. All VDOT pace-personalised.
2. **Squad / Split Leader** — private accountability squads of up to 5. Orbital UI, nudges, leaderboard, collective goals.
3. **Coaching marketplace** — verified coaches, plan marketplace, athlete management tools.
